# Dice Exposition
Dice Exposition (c) 2000 Beem Media All rights reserved.

Dice Exposition is a prototype for a dice game. I never completed it because it
wasn't much fun. What happened was I was in math class and a student teacher had
us play this dice game as a demonstration and I thought to myself I bet I could
program that. So I went home and programmed this. I actually think he the
student teacher had programmed his version of the dice game himself as well and
that was the whole reason he was using it in class.

Originally I inteded to include a bunch of different dice games, but I only ever
made the one game included.

## Building
Dice Exposition can be run in a QBasic interpreter. It cannot be compiled by
QBasic 4.5 because it uses too much memory.

## History
Origin: 2000 (probably earlier)
